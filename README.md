IGMMake: GedCom to Web program written in PERL

I'm abandoning IGM IGMMake in favor of a new project I'm working on called GIMM (GedCom in Memory Method) (or for now printVeryLargeTextPedigrees) that puts a local gedcom file into memory before serving web pages, thus elavating the need to make the several disk requests each time a page is called. My 50,000 person pedigree chart on IGM, which takes 3 minutes to load, takes less than a second on GIMM (printVeryLargeTextPedigrees).
